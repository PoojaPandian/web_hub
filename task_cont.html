                    I bought this course because I have struggled to make my own website for my solo language coaching business for 8 years. I got stuck on the copy every single time. I wanted to learn how to persuade potential clients to get in touch with me because selling my service in a foreign language market is extremely difficult. Henneke's course saved me. I loved the recipes that teach you, step by step, how to organize your sales page and what to say in each section. Each section has an objective. Plus, the example layouts for different kinds of businesses were invaluable.

                    I've done a couple of writing courses in the past and I have loads of ideas. But I get overwhelmed and I'm not good at structuring my writing. So I still felt stuck. After reading Henneke's blog for a few months, I purchased the Enchanting Blog Writing course because I like the way her blog posts read and because I hoped the course would give me some direction and motivation to sort out my blog.

                    I was unsure if the Enchanting Copywriting course would apply to my small e-commerce store; I thought it might be more suitable for higher-priced offerings like an e-course or coaching sessions. I also own both of Henneke's copywriting books and was afraid there would be some overlap. But my product descriptions were sprawling all over the place and I needed a better understanding of the structure of persuasive sales copy, so I took the leap and I'm glad I did.
